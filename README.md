# Osmen
This App will take a video and use voice recognition and google images to overlay an image every couple seconds which reflects what the person is saying.

# Action Plan
- UI will be made with Electron and reactjs. Check out this [Medium Article](https://medium.com/heuristics/electron-react-python-part-2-architecture-d49634521efd.)
- Need to develop system for getting images for video using speech recognition.
- Write or Adapt script for downloading the images based on script and config.
- Stich images and video together according to settings which will be placed in UI.
- ***Voila!***
